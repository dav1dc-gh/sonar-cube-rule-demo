Generate a detailed and unique set of Copilot custom instructions specific to each major path under the /rules directory.
This translates into a path specific custom instruction for each of the following paths:
- /rules/security
- /rules/code-smells
- /rules/performance
- /rules/maintainability
The custom instructions should guide the AI assistant on how to help users create, manage, and understand SonarQube Rules Files within each specific category effectively.
